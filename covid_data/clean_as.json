The VCPR is the professional relationship between the veterinarian, client (e.g., animal owner or caretaker), and the animal patient(s). The federal VCPR definition requires that veterinarians physically examine animal patients and/or make medically appropriate and timely visits to the location where the animals are kept. Therefore, the federal VCPR definition cannot be met solely through telemedicine. To help veterinarians utilize telemedicine to address animal health needs during the COVID-19 pandemic, FDA does not intend to enforce the animal examination and premises visit portion of the VCPR requirements relevant to FDA regulations governing Extralabel Drug Use in Animals and Veterinary Feed Directive (VFD) drugs. This will allow veterinarians to prescribe drugs in an extralabel manner or authorize the use of VFD drugs without direct examination of or making visits to their patients, which will limit person-to-person interaction and the potential spread of COVID-19 in the community.
