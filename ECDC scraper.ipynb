Despite the relatively low mortality rate for seasonal influenza, many people die from the disease due to the large number of people who contract it each year. The concern about COVID-19 is that, unlike influenza, there is no vaccine and no specific treatment for the disease. It also appears to be more transmissible than seasonal influenza. As it is a new virus, nobody has prior immunity, which means that the entire human population is potentially susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection.',\n"," 'While animals are believed to be the original source, the virus spread is now from person to person (human-to-human\\xa0transmission).\\xa0There is\\xa0not\\xa0enough epidemiological information at this time to determine\\xa0how easily this virus spreads\\xa0between people, but it is currently estimated that, on average, one infected person will infect between two and three other people.\\xa0',\n"," 'The virus\\xa0seems to be\\xa0transmitted\\xa0mainly\\xa0via\\xa0small respiratory droplets through sneezing, coughing, or when people interact with each other for some time in close proximity (usually less than one metre).

Reports show that clinical deterioration can occur rapidly, often during the second week of disease.',\n"," 'Recently, anosmia – loss of the sense of smell – (and in some cases the loss of the sense of taste) have been reported as a symptom of a COVID-19 infection.

Also, if grandparents are asked to care for the children, the benefits of lower transmission between children might be offset by transmission into a more vulnerable population group.

This is approximately 1 in every 1 000 people who are infected. Despite the relatively low mortality rate for seasonal influenza, many people die from the disease due to the large number of people who contract it each year. The concern about COVID-19 is that, unlike influenza, there is no vaccine and no specific treatment for the disease. It also appears to be more transmissible than seasonal influenza.

Reports show that clinical deterioration can occur rapidly, often during the second week of disease.',\n"," 'Recently, anosmia – loss of the sense of smell – (and in some cases the loss of the sense of taste) have been reported as a symptom of a COVID-19 infection.

Testing approaches will be adapted to the situation at national and local level. National authorities may decide to test only subgroups of suspected cases based on the national capacity to test, the availability of necessary equipment for testing, the level of community transmission of COVID-19, or other criteria.',\n"," 'As a resource conscious approach, ECDC has suggested that national authorities may consider prioritising testing in the following groups:',\n"," 'If you are feeling ill with COVID-19 symptoms (such as fever, cough, difficulty breathing, muscle pain or general weakness), it is recommended that you contact your local healthcare services online or by telephone.

Physical distancing measures might be implemented over an extended period and their success depends on ensuring that people maintain social contact – from a distance – with friends, family and colleagues.

What are the symptoms of\\xa0COVID-19 infection\\nSymptoms of COVID-19 vary in severity from having no symptoms at all (being asymptomatic) to having fever, cough, sore throat, general weakness and fatigue and muscular pain and in the most severe cases, severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis and septic shock, all potentially leading to death. Reports show that clinical deterioration can occur rapidly, often during the second week of disease.\\nRecently, anosmia – loss of the sense of smell – (and in some cases the loss of the sense of taste) have been reported as a symptom of a COVID-19 infection. There is already evidence from South Korea, China and Italy that patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection have developed anosmia/hyposmia, in some cases in the absence of any other symptoms.\\n2. Are some people more at risk than others?\\nElderly\\xa0people above 70 years of age and those\\xa0with underlying health conditions (e.g.\\xa0hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory disease and cancer) are\\xa0considered to be more at risk of developing severe symptoms. Men in these groups also appear to be at a slightly higher risk than females.\\n3. Are children also at risk of infection and what is their potential role in transmission?\\nChildren make up a very small proportion of reported COVID-19 cases, with about 1% of all cases reported being under 10 years, and 4% aged 10-19 years. Children appear as likely to be infected as adults, but they have a much lower risk than adults of developing symptoms or severe disease. There is still some uncertainty about the extent to which asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic children transmit disease.\\n4. What is the risk of infection in pregnant women and neonates?\\nThere is limited scientific evidence on the severity of illness in pregnant women after COVID-19 infection. It seems that pregnant women appear to experience similar clinical manifestations as\\xa0non-pregnant\\xa0women who have progressed to COVID-19 pneumonia and to date (as of 25 March), there have been no maternal deaths, no pregnancy losses and only one stillbirth reported. No current evidence suggests that infection with COVID-19 during pregnancy has a negative effect on the foetus. At present, there is no evidence of transmission of COVID-19 from mother to baby during pregnancy and only one confirmed COVID-19 neonatal case has been reported to date.\\nECDC will continue to monitor the emerging scientific literature on this question, and suggests that all pregnant women follow the same general precautions for the prevention of COVID-19, including regular handwashing, avoiding individuals who are sick, and self-isolating in case of any symptoms, while consulting a healthcare provider by telephone for advice.\\n5. Is there a treatment for the COVID-19\\xa0disease?\\nThere is no specific treatment or vaccine for this disease.\\nHealthcare providers are mostly using a symptomatic approach, meaning they treat the symptoms rather than target the virus, and provide supportive care (e.g. oxygen therapy, fluid management) for infected persons, which can be highly effective.\\nIn severe and critically ill patients, a number of drugs are being tried to target the virus, but the use of these need to be more carefully assessed in randomised controlled trials. Several clinical trials are ongoing to assess their effectiveness but results are not yet available.\\nAs this is a new virus, no vaccine is currently available. Although work on a vaccine has already started by several research groups and pharmaceutical companies worldwide, it may be months to more than a year before a vaccine has been tested and is ready for use in humans.\\n6. When should I be tested for COVID-19?\\nCurrent advice for testing depends on the stage of the outbreak in the country or area where you live. Testing approaches will be adapted to the situation at national and local level. National authorities may decide to test only subgroups of suspected cases based on the national capacity to test, the availability of necessary equipment for testing, the level of community transmission of COVID-19, or other criteria.\\nAs a resource conscious approach, ECDC has suggested that national authorities may consider prioritising testing in the following groups:\\nhospitalised patients with severe respiratory infections;\\nsymptomatic healthcare staff including those with mild symptoms;\\ncases with acute respiratory infections in hospital or long-term care facilities;\\npatients with acute respiratory infections or influenza-like illness in certain outpatient clinics or hospitals;\\nelderly people with underlying chronic medical conditions such as lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, and immunocompromising conditions.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n"," 'Medical information\\n1.

What should I do if I develop symptoms of COVID-19?\\nFollow the guidelines of the public health authorities in your area on the steps to take or call the local COVID-19 helpline.\\n5. Are face masks effective in protecting against COVID-19?\\nIf you are infected, the use of surgical face masks may reduce the risk of you infecting other people. On the other hand there is\\xa0no evidence\\xa0that face masks will effectively prevent you from becoming infected with the virus. In fact, it is possible that the use of face masks may even increase the risk of infection due to a false sense of security and increased contact between hands, mouth and eyes while wearing them. The inappropriate use of masks also may increase the risk of infection.\\n6. Is there a vaccine against the virus?\\xa0\\nThere are currently no vaccines against human coronaviruses,\\xa0including the virus that causes COVID-19. This\\xa0is\\xa0why\\xa0it is very important to\\xa0prevent\\xa0infection\\xa0and to take measures to contain further spread of\\xa0the virus. \\n7.

Touching the face with unwashed hands should be avoided. Travellers should avoid contact with sick persons, in particular those with respiratory symptoms and fever. It should be emphasised that older people and those with underlying health conditions should take these precautionary measures very seriously.

As a general precaution, it is always wise to observe basic\\xa0principles of\\xa0hygiene\\xa0when in contact with animals.\\n',\n"," ' \\n\\n\\nCoronavirus\\n\\nCOVID-19\\n\\nPublic health threat\\n\\nScientific advice\\n\\n\\n',\n"," '\\n\\n\\nTwitter\\n\\n\\n\\nFacebook\\n\\n\\n\\nLinked In\\n\\n\\n\\nMail\\n\\n\\n\\n']"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":13}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"UwXeQ9oLis0g","colab_type":"text"},"source":["Everything is clean, so now I will read in my manually created csv and put it in a dataframe."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-oAbEW8aTiaI","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["import pandas as pd"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"b3ifG4uuTlAs","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["df = pd.read_csv('/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Datasets/COVID Chat Bot/ecdc_qa.csv', names=['questions', 'answers'])"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1_HyCcxtT2VP","colab_type":"code","outputId":"951cbfa3-97b9-4fd3-a0ed-1dd27cb59d5c","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1586207097642,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":290,"user":{"displayName":"Daniel Moore","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14Gj0LpL-hu169RD5uOvSoMS5Ja4MNM6gnH89MbKU=s64","userId":"03990109818721859613"}},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":198}},"source":["df.head(5)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>questions</th>\n","      <th>answers</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>What is SARS-CoV-2?</td>\n","      <td>Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>What is COVID-19?</td>\n","      <td>COVID-19 is the name given to the disease asso...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>Where do coronaviruses come from?</td>\n","      <td>Cronaviruses are viruses that circulate among ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>Is this virus comparable to SARS or to the sea...</td>\n","      <td>The novel coronavirus detected in China in 201...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>What is the mode of transmission?</td>\n","      <td>While animals are believed to be the original ...</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["                                           questions                                            answers\n","0                                What is SARS-CoV-2?
